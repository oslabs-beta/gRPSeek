## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This tool is designed to provide comprehensive load testing for gRPC services, allowing developers to simulate various levels of load and analyze server response metrics. By offering real-time insights into latency, throughput, and stream message transmission, it enables the identification and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. The tool's robust testing capabilities ensure that new code does not introduce performance regression, and it plays a vital role in meeting required concurrency and inference response times. Integrated with visualizations and intuitive dashboards, it offers a complete solution for optimizing gRPC service performance and reliability.

## Built With

Whilst I was the main developer of this project, this project couldn't of even started without the help of these open source projects, special thanks to:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React]()

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This program has no pre-requisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kennysghub/gRPSeek-v2
```

2. Install dependencies

3. Have fun!

## Usage

Coming Soon!

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/gRPSeek/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

- If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/gRPSeek/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the _README.md_ file with necessary changes.
- Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
- Create individual PR for each suggestion.
- Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/gRPSeek/issues/) before posting your first idea as well.

### Creating A Pull Request
