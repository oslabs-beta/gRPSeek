## About The Project

This tool is designed to provide comprehensive load testing for gRPC services, allowing developers to simulate various levels of load and analyze server response metrics. By offering real-time insights into latency, throughput, and stream message transmission, it enables the identification and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. The tool's robust testing capabilities ensure that new code does not introduce performance regression, and it plays a vital role in meeting required concurrency and inference response times. Integrated with visualizations and intuitive dashboards, it offers a complete solution for optimizing gRPC service performance and reliability.


## Built With


- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
